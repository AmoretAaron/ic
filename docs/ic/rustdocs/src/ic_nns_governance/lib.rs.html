<span class="doccomment">//! The purpose of the Network Nervous System (NNS) is to allow the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Internet Computer (IC) network to be governed in an open,</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! decentralized and secure manner. It has complete control over all</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! aspects of the IC network. For example, it can upgrade the protocol</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! and software used by the node machines that host the network, it</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! can induct new node operators and machines into the network, it</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! can create new subnets (special blockchains) to increase network</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! capacity, it can split subnets to divide their load, it can</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! configure economic parameters that control how much must be paid</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! by users for compute capacity, and in extremis it can freeze</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! malicious canister software (smart contracts) in order to protect</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! the network, and many other things. The NNS works by accepting</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! proposals, and deciding to adopt or reject them based on voting</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! activity by “neurons” that network participants have created.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Neurons are also used by participants to submit new</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! proposals. After submission, proposals are either adopted or</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! rejected, which can happen almost immediately, or after some</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! delay, depending upon how the totality of neurons vote. Each</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! proposal is an instance of a specific “proposal type”, which</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! determines what information it contains. For each type of</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! proposal, the NNS maintains a corresponding system function, which</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! it invokes whenever an instance of the type is adopted. When a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! proposal is adopted by the NNS, it invokes the corresponding</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! system function by drawing information from the proposal’s content</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! to fill the parameters. Each type of proposal belongs to a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! specific “proposal topic”, such as “#NodeAdmin” or</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! “#NetworkEconomics”, which determines details about how it will be</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! processed. To prevent users spamming the NNS, a fee is levied on</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! the neuron that submitted a proposal if it is rejected.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The NNS decides whether to adopt or reject proposals by watching</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! how neurons emit votes. Anyone can create a neuron by locking</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! balances of “ICP governance tokens”, a special native utility</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! token that is hosted on a ledger inside the NNS. When a user</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! creates a neuron, the locked balance of ICP can only be unlocked</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! by fully dissolving (“destroying”) the neuron. Users are</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! incentivized to create neurons because they earn rewards when they</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! vote on proposals. Rewards take the form of newly minted ICP that</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! are created by the NNS. The quantity of ICP rewards disbursed to a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! neuron derive from such factors as the size of the locked balance,</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! the minimum lockup period remaining (the “dissolve delay”), the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! neuron’s “age”, the proportion of possible votes it has correctly</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! participated in, and the sum of voting activity across all</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! neurons, since the overall total rewards disbursed is capped and</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! must be divided.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Each neuron has a currently configured “dissolve delay”. At any</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! moment, this determines how long it will take to dissolve if it is</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! placed into “dissolve mode”. Once a neuron has been placed into</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! “dissolve mode”, its dissolve delay falls over the passage of</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! time, rather like a kitchen timer, until it reaches zero,</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! whereupon its owner can perform a final action to make it dissolve</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! completely, and unlock the balance of ICP. The dissolve delay</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! creates an economic incentive for neuron owners to vote with a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! view to maximizing the value of their locked ICP balances at a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! future date. Since the price of ICP is a proxy for the success of</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! the network over the long term, sans short-term volatility, this</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! creates an economic incentive to vote in the best interests of the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! network. Neuron owners can freely configure higher dissolve</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! delays, up to a maximum delay of 8 years, but cannot configure</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! lower dissolve delays. The NNS pays higher voting rewards the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! higher the dissolve delay, encouraging users to enter a game in</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! which an economic incentive is created to vote according to a very</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! long term vision.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Neuron owners may find it hard to manually direct voting on every</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! proposal submitted to the NNS. Firstly, large volumes of proposals</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! may be submitted to the NNS, often at awkward times, and owners</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! may not be available or have the time necessary to evaluate each</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! one. Secondly, neuron owners may lack the necessary expertise to</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! evaluate proposals themselves. The NNS uses a form of liquid</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! democracy to address these challenges. For any proposal topic, a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! neuron can be configured to vote automatically by following the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! votes of a group of neurons, voting to adopt proposals whenever a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! majority of the followees vote to adopt, and voting to reject</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! whenever that becomes impossible. A catch-all follow rule may also</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! be defined to make a neuron vote automatically on proposals with</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! topics for which no follow rule has been defined. It is assumed</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! that neuron owners will manage how their neurons follow other</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! neurons in the best interests of the network, which is also in</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! their own economic interests, owing to their locked ICP balances.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! It is expected that a large proportion of the overall supply of</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ICP will be locked in order to earn rewards. This secures the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Internet Computer network’s governance, by making it both</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! difficult and exorbitantly expensive for an attacker to acquire a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! sufficiently large stake to gain significant influence. Since</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! neuron owners will wish to maximize their rewards by voting on all</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! proposals, most neurons will either be actively managed, or</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! configured to follow other neurons so they can vote</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! automatically. In practice, once trusted neurons have voted on</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! proposals, a majority of the other neurons will also vote as the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! result of cascading follow relationships. This means the NNS can</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! usually quickly determine whether a majority of the overall voting</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! power represented by all neurons wishes to adopt or reject a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! proposal, and decide on the proposal accordingly. However, the NNS</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! cannot rely upon obtaining such a majority, since in principle,</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! neuron owners may not define follow rules, or simply choose not to</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! vote.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! When the treatment of a newly submitted proposal is not quickly</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! decided by a majority of the overall voting power, the NNS must</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! use a technique once described as “Wait For Quiet”. This involves</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! deriving a measure of “voting noise” from the volume of ongoing</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! voting on a proposal, and waiting for it to fall below some</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! threshold (which value is a tuning parameter that the NNS can</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! modify in production according to experience), and then proceeding</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! to tally the votes received that far to decide. Different</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! algorithms can be applied, but most simply, the NNS can use a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! running average of the votes received every time interval as the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! measure of “voting noise”. If the threshold is too low, an</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! attacker can delay the NNS from deciding on proposals by voting</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! just as the “noise level” is about to fall beneath the threshold,</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! and it cannot be made too high, or else an attacker might try to</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! DoS the NNS so that it decides on proposals using only a small</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! proportion of the voting power that wanted to participate (since</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! it equates their not being able to vote, with their not wanting to</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! vote). Using Wait For Quiet, the NNS can decide on proposals</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! without need for a quorum of voting power to participate, and it</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! can also always decide upon proposals in a timely manner.</span>
