The configuration of such follow rules can be used to a) distribute control over voting power amongst multiple entities, b) have a neuron vote automatically when its owner lacks time to evaluate newly submitted proposals, c) have a neuron vote automatically when its own lacks the expertise to evaluate newly submitted proposals, and d) for other purposes. A follow rule specifies a set of followees. Once a majority of the followees votes to adopt or reject a proposal belonging to the specified topic, the neuron votes the same way. If it becomes impossible for a majority of the followees to adopt (for example, because they are split 50-50 between adopt and reject), then the neuron votes to reject. If a rule is specified where the proposal topic is UNSPECIFIED, then it becomes a catch-all follow rule, which will be used to vote automatically on proposals belonging to topics for which no specific rule has been specified."],["IncreaseDissolveDelay","The dissolve delay of a neuron can be increased up to a maximum of 8 years."],["RegisterVote","Have the neuron vote to either adopt or reject a proposal with a specified id."],["RemoveHotKey","Remove a hot key that has been previously assigned to the neuron."],["Spawn","When the maturity of a neuron has risen above a threshold, it can be instructed to spawn a new neuron.
